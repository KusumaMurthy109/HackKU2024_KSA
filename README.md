**WishMate - HackKU 2024 Project**

This is a project created for HackKU 2024, created by Kusuma Murthy, Sophia Jacob, and Anna Lin.

WishMate has been created to serve various non-profit organizations and charitable drives to create a seamless flow between the volunteers and the organizers. WishMate is an app that allows an organizer to create different wishlists for drives like a food drive or a Toys for Tots Drive. Volunteers can then sign up and log in to the App to view drives and wishlists happening near them.

WishMate stemmed from the experiences of teammate, Sophia, who was the Volunteer Coordinator for her Church and ran through several issues when trying to organize food drives, jacket drives, and toy drives. Oftentimes, there would not be enough people that knew about the drive or about the list of items to get. There was no good way to connect between organizations and the volunteers. Therefore, WishMate alleviates this by allowing for organizations and volunteers to interact directly by uploading, viewing, and accessing wishlists for drives.

This will help compell people to volunteer more often for drives and allow organizations to spread their good work to the targetted communities.

Installing the WishMate app is very simple. Start by cloning this GitHub repo as seen below.
git clone git@github.com:KusumaMurthy109/HackKU2024_KSA.git

Once it is installed, then we can run the wishmate_login.py, and make sure to install any of the other independencies needed, or modules by doing pip install [module_name].
